# Game-of-Life
Implementation of John Conway's game of life in MS Fortran 5.1 and MSAM

I learned Fortran in 1991 when I was a student in university. At that time, I thought the assembly language was the most pupular language, because I heard the discussion from my classmates when I was in senior high school. I did not have a personal computer at that time, so I just read the book of assembly language and never try it on computer, due to I do not have any compiler. 
During these years, the Winworld, old-dos.ru, vetusware.com... publish the old dos software freely. I have the chance to download the required compiler and material to learn and rewirte the game of life program, which I already implemented during 1992.
I learned assembly these 2018's years by reading the 汇编语言(第3版) 》王爽著. and finally I know all the knowledge of assembly language and how to write.

Here is the better implementation game of life than I did in 1992. It is writtenin Fortran and Assembly mixed language.
The program can be controlled by mouse. The player can draw the life map by lefe mouse button down. Then, press 'N' or 'n' to see the next generation of life and Right click to quit game. 

The IDE environment is running in the DOSBOX virtual machine. All the required compiler I have zipped and put it in this repository.

The video of the compile and game is shown in GameOfLife.mp4. Also can be seen in Youtube https://youtu.be/JLbLT61EvTE
